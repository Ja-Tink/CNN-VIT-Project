# CNN-VIT-Project
Lana Lee, Alex Manko, Jack Tinker Advanced Topics Project

This project explores methods to combine the stregnths of CNNs and the more modern vision transformers. We used the Food-101 dataset, introduced in [Bossard, L, et al.](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-10599-4_29), to evaluate the efficacy of our approachs.

`CODE.ipynb` contains all code for this project, including data loading and preprocessing, model definition, training, and evaluation.



Below are sample predictions produced by our final model. (Code to produce such results can be found at the end of the notebook)
